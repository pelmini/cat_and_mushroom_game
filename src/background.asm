; Nametables and attribute tables Demo for NES
; Following on from the background palette program, this program looks at how
; to load a pattern table, which contains the actual graphic tiles, a nametable,
; which contains the layout of graphic tiles for the background, and the
; attribute table, which specifies what palette to paint everything with.
;
; I am not an artist, and even then, converting bitmaps to pattern tables can be
; a chore.  So, I used the "Generitiles" from the NESDev wiki
; (https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Placeholder_graphics).  I then ran these
; through a Python script supplied by Damian Yerrick 
; (https://github.com/pinobatch/nesbgeditor) which converts a 2-bit PNG into
; pattern tables pretty darn effectively.  Thanks, Damian!
; 
; So, we're now *finally* using the CHARS section, which gets directly mapped
; into the PPU's memory at power on.  This section really should more
; be named "CHR-ROM", as this is the more common name for it.  You'll notice
; that I can directly include the file produced by Damian's tools, which keeps
; the code tidy.
;
; With the patterns directly mapped in, the next step is to load up some data
; in the name table.  Since we're not doing anything fancy, I've restricted
; things to the first of the two name tables.  Much like we did for loading the
; palette colors, we load this through the use of PPUADDR and PPUDATA.
;
; Finally, we load the attribute table, which says which palette to use for
; each 32x32 pixel region on the screen.  In a more advanced demo, this would
; raise the number of effective colors I was using on the screen.  For now,
; though, I just want to keep things simple and easy-to-explain.
;
; Note that the annyoing "hello world" sound is now gone.  The graphics show
; that everything is working.

  ; Interesting little fact I learned along the way.  Because it takes two
  ; stores on PPUADDR to move its pointer, it's good practice to start all of
  ; your PPUADDR use with a peek at PPUSTATUS since this resets its "latch"
  ; and ensures you're addressing the address you expect.
  ; Technically, we don't need this because we did it in the reset code, but
  ; it's a neat little thing to mention here
